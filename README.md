Test Cases for Secure File Sharing
Test Case 1: File Upload - Valid File

Description: Upload a valid file to the secure file-sharing system.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has the necessary permissions.
Test Steps:
Select a valid file (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .jpg).
Upload the file.
Expected Result: The file should upload successfully with a confirmation message.
Test Case 2: File Upload - Invalid File Format

Description: Upload a file with an unsupported format.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has the necessary permissions.
Test Steps:
Select an unsupported file format (e.g., .exe, .bat).
Attempt to upload the file.
Expected Result: The system should reject the upload and display an error message indicating unsupported file format.
Test Case 3: File Download - Valid File

Description: Download a valid file.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has permission to download the file.
Test Steps:
Select a file to download.
Click the download button.
Expected Result: The file should download successfully to the user’s device.
Test Case 4: File Download - Unauthorized User

Description: Try to download a file without proper permissions.
Preconditions: User is logged in but does not have the necessary permissions for the file.
Test Steps:
Attempt to download a file that is restricted.
Expected Result: The system should display an error message indicating that the user does not have permission to download the file.
Test Case 5: File Share - Valid Recipient

Description: Share a file with a valid recipient.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has a valid file.
Test Steps:
Select a file to share.
Enter the recipient’s email address or username.
Send the file.
Expected Result: The recipient should receive a notification and be able to access the file.
Test Case 6: File Share - Invalid Recipient

Description: Attempt to share a file with an invalid recipient (e.g., invalid email or username).
Preconditions: User is logged in and has a valid file.
Test Steps:
Select a file to share.
Enter an invalid recipient’s email address or username.
Attempt to send the file.
Expected Result: The system should reject the request and display an error message indicating the recipient is invalid.
Test Case 7: File Encryption

Description: Ensure the file is encrypted before sharing.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has a file to share.
Test Steps:
Select a file to share.
Verify if the file is encrypted before it is sent.
Expected Result: The file should be encrypted before it is shared, ensuring privacy and security.
Test Case 8: File Deletion

Description: Delete a file that was uploaded or shared.
Preconditions: User has uploaded or shared a file.
Test Steps:
Select a file to delete.
Click the delete button.
Expected Result: The file should be deleted, and the system should confirm the action.
Test Case 9: File Sharing Limits

Description: Ensure the system respects file-sharing limits (e.g., maximum file size or number of recipients).
Preconditions: User is logged in and has a file to share.
Test Steps:
Attempt to share a file that exceeds the system's size limits.
Attempt to share a file with more than the allowed number of recipients.
Expected Result: The system should reject requests that exceed the file-sharing limits and display an error message.
Test Case 10: User Logout

Description: Ensure that logging out from the system invalidates the user’s session and access to shared files.
Preconditions: User is logged in and has files shared with them.
Test Steps:
Log out from the secure file-sharing system.
Try to access a previously shared file.
Expected Result: The system should not allow access to shared files after logging out, and the user should be redirected to the login page.
Deployment Plan for Secure File Sharing
Preparation:

Ensure all test cases have been executed successfully in the development environment.
Prepare production server (cloud-based or on-premise) with the necessary infrastructure.
Backup current production data to prevent loss during deployment.
Set up staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible for final testing.
File Encryption and Security:

Implement secure file transfer protocols such as HTTPS.
Use strong encryption methods for storing and sharing files (e.g., AES-256).
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict file access based on user roles and permissions.
Testing:

Perform load testing to simulate real-world traffic and ensure the system can handle peak demands.
Conduct penetration testing to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with a subset of actual users to ensure that the application meets the business requirements.
Deployment Steps:

Deploy the application to the production server.
Configure necessary server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Node.js) and database connections (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for production environment.
Set up appropriate logging and monitoring systems to track errors, performance issues, and user activities.
Implement auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes if the application is hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure).
Post-Deployment:

Monitor the system for any errors or slowdowns during the initial hours of production use.
Continuously check security and file sharing integrity to avoid breaches.
Provide a feedback channel for users to report issues and suggest improvements.
Rollback Plan:

In case of critical issues, have a rollback procedure in place to revert to the previous stable version of the application.
By following these steps, you can ensure a secure and efficient deployment of your secure file-sharing system to the production environment.
